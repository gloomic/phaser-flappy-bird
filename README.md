# Flappy Bird with Phaser 3

An example of Flappy Bird written with Phaser 3. You can take this as a start point to write your own Phaser3 games.

## About it

This example contains 4 versions of the the game Flappy Bird. Every latter version is based on the previous one and add some new features:

- Version 1, a basic version with only about 100 lines of JavaScript code.
- Version 2, adds more pipes.
- Version 3, adds animation and audio.
- Version 4, adds a start menu and restart feature.

The topics involved in the game cover: scenes, sprites, collisions, animations, audio and tweens.
